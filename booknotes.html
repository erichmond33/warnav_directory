<h2 id="the-war-of-art">The War of Art</h2>
<p><em>by Steven Pressfield</em></p>

<p>It's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write.</p>

<p>Have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be? Are you a writer who doesn't write, a painter who doesn't paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what "Resistance" is.</p>

<details>
  <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #00FF41; font-weight: 500; margin: 10px 0;">see more</summary>
  </div>
<p>How many of us have become drunks and drug addicts, developed tumors and neuroses, succumbed to painkillers, gossip, and compulsive cell-phone use, simply because we don't do that thing that our hearts, our inner genius, is calling us to? Resistance defeats us.</p>

<p>If tomorrow morning, every dazed and benighted soul woke up with the power to take the first step toward pursuing his or her dreams, every shrink in the directory would be out of business. Prisons would stand empty. The alcohol and tobacco industries would collapse, along with the junk food, cosmetic surgery, and infotainment businesses, not to mention pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and the medical profession from top to bottom. Domestic abuse would become extinct, as would addiction, obesity, migraine headaches, and road rage.</p>

<p>Dad gets drunk, Mom gets sick, Janie shows up for church with an Oakland Raiders tattoo. It's more fun than a movie. And it works: Nobody gets a damn thing done.</p>

<p>The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it.</p>

<p>We don't tell ourselves, "I'm never going to write my symphony." Instead we say, "I am going to write my symphony; I'm just going to start tomorrow."</p>

<p>At a big New York ad agency, our boss used to tell us: Invent a disease. Come up with the disease, he said, and we can sell the cure. Attention Deficit Disorder, Seasonal Affect Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder. These aren't diseases, they're marketing ploys. Doctors didn't discover them, copywriters did. Marketing departments did. Drug companies did.</p>

<p>Jerry Seinfeld observed of his twenty years of dating: "That's a lot of acting fascinated."</p>

<p>Resistance also told me I shouldn't seek to instruct, or put myself forward as a purveyor of wisdom; that this was vain, egotistical, possibly even corrupt,</p>

<p>What does Resistance feel like? First, unhappiness. We feel like hell. A low-grade misery pervades everything. We're bored, we're restless.</p>

<p>We live in a consumer culture that's acutely aware of this unhappiness and has massed all its profit-seeking artillery to exploit it. By selling us a product, a drug, a distraction.</p>

<p>The artist and the fundamentalist arise from societies at differing stages of development. The artist is the advanced model. His culture possesses affluence, stability, enough excess of resource to permit the luxury of self-examination. The artist is grounded in freedom. He is not afraid of it. He is lucky. He was born in the right place. He has a core of selfconfidence, of hope for the future. He believes in progress and evolution. His faith is that humankind is advancing, however haltingly and imperfectly, toward a better world. The fundamentalist entertains no such notion. In his view, humanity has fallen from a higher state. The truth is not out there awaiting revelation; it has already been revealed. The word of God has been spoken and recorded by His prophet, be he Jesus, Muhammad, or Karl Marx. Fundamentalism is the philosophy of the powerless, the conquered, the displaced and the dispossessed.</p>

<p>The fundamentalist cannot stand freedom. He cannot find his way into the future, so he retreats to the past. He returns in imagination to the glory days.</p>

<p>His creativity is inverted. He creates destruction.</p>

<p>Fundamentalism and art are mutually exclusive. There is no such thing as fundamentalist art.</p>

<p>The truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery.</p>

<p>Those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.</p>

<p>Individuals who are realized in their own lives almost never criticize others. If they speak at all, it is to offer encouragement.</p>

<p>Inside the Actors Studio: The host, James Lipton, invariably asks his guests, "What factors make you decide to take a particular role?" The actor always answers: "Because I'm afraid of it." The professional tackles the project that will make him stretch. He takes on the assignment that will bear him into uncharted waters, compel him to explore unconscious parts of himself. Is he scared? Hell, yes. He's petrified. (Conversely, the professional turns down roles that he's done before. He's not afraid of them anymore. Why waste his time?) So if you're paralyzed with fear, it's a good sign. It shows you what you have to do.</p>

<p>If you're feeling massive Resistance, the good news is, it means there's tremendous love there too. If you didn't love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn't feel anything.</p>

<p>(Santa Barbara and Ojai, California): populated by upper-middle-class people with more time and money than they know what to do with, in which a culture of healing also obtains. The concept in all these environments seems to be that one needs to complete his healing before he is ready to do his work. This way of thinking is a form of Resistance. What are we trying to heal, anyway? The athlete knows the day will never come when he wakes up pain-free. He has to play hurt.</p>

<p>What better way of avoiding work than going to a workshop?</p>

<p>What I hate even worse is the word "support". Any support we get from persons of flesh and blood is like Monopoly money; it's not legal tender in that sphere where we have to do our work.</p>

<p>"Who can get through the day without two or three juicy rationalizations. They're more important than sex. Have you ever gone a week without a rationalization?"</p>

<p>Rationalization: a series of plausible, rational justifications for why we shouldn't do our work.</p>

<p>A lot of them are true. But all this means diddly. Tolstoy had thirteen kids and wrote War and Peace. Lance Armstrong had cancer and won the Tour de France.</p>

<p>The working artist will not tolerate trouble in her life because she knows trouble prevents her from doing her work.</p>

<p>In order for a book (or any project or enterprise) to hold our attention for the length of time it takes to unfold itself, it has to plug into some internal perplexity or passion that is of paramount importance to us.</p>

<p>The more psychic energy we expend dredging and re-dredging the tired, boring injustices of our personal lives, the less juice we have to do our work.</p>

<p>Amateur comes from the Latin root meaning "to love." The conventional interpretation is that the amateur pursues his calling out of love, while the pro does it for money. Not the way I see it. In my view, the amateur does not love the game enough. If he did, he would not pursue it as a sideline, distinct from his "real" vocation. The professional loves it so much he dedicates his life to it. He commits full-time. That's what I mean when I say turning pro. Resistance hates it when we turn pro.</p>

<p>Inspiration strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp.</p>

<p>Resistance; I will not let it faze me; I will sit down and do my work.</p>

<p>The Marine Corps teaches you how to be miserable. This is invaluable for an artist.</p>

<p>The artist committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell: a diet of isolation, rejection, self-doubt, despair, ridicule, contempt, and humiliation.</p>

<p>The qualities that define us as professionals?<br>
1) We show up every day.<br>
2) We show up no matter what.<br>
3) We stay on the job all day. Our minds may wander, but our bodies remain at the wheel.<br>
6) We accept remuneration for our labor. We're not here for fun. We work for money.<br>
7) We do not overidentify with our jobs.<br>
8) We master the technique of our jobs.</p>

<p>The amateur, on the other hand, overidentifies with his avocation, his artistic aspiration. He defines himself by it. He is a musician, a painter, a playwright. Resistance loves this. Resistance knows that the amateur composer will never write his symphony because he is overly invested in its success and overterrified of its failure. The amateur takes it so seriously it paralyzes him.</p>

<p>Now consider the amateur: the aspiring painter, the wannabe playwright. How does he pursue his calling? One, he doesn't show up every day. Two, he doesn't show up no matter what. Three, he doesn't stay on the job all day. He is not committed over the long haul; the stakes for him are illusory and fake. He does not get money. And he overidentifies with his art. He does not have a sense of humor about failure.</p>

<p>The professional, though he accepts money, does his work out of love. He has to love it. Otherwise he wouldn't devote his life to it of his own free will. The professional has learned, however, that too much love can be a bad thing. Too much love can make him choke. The seeming detachment of the professional, the cold-blooded character to his demeanor, is a compensating device to keep him from loving the game so much that he freezes in action. Playing for money, or adopting the attitude of one who plays for money, lowers the fever.</p>

<p>The pro concentrates on technique. The professional masters how, and leaves what and why to the gods.</p>

<p>Professional respects his craft. He does not consider himself superior to it. He wants to be in possession of the full arsenal of skills when inspiration does come.</p>

<p>It wants us to stake our self-worth, our identity, our reason-for-being, on the response of others to our work. Resistance knows we can't take this. No one can. The professional blows critics off. He doesn't even hear them. Critics, he reminds himself, are the unwitting mouthpieces of Resistance</p>

<p>Critics: They can articulate in their reviews the same toxic venom that Resistance itself concocts inside our heads. That is their real evil. Not that we believe them, but that we believe the Resistance in our own minds, for which critics serve as unconscious spokespersons.</p>

<p>The professional recognizes his limitations: He gets an agent, gets a lawyer, gets an accountant. He knows she can only be a professional at one thing. He brings in other pros and treats them with respect.</p>

<p>Making yourself a corporation (or just thinking of yourself in that way) reinforces the idea of professionalism because it separates the artist-doing-the-work from the will-and-consciousness-running-the-show.</p>

<p>If we think of ourselves as a corporation, it gives us a healthy distance on ourselves. We're less subjective. We don't take blows as personally.</p>

<p>The most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.</p>

<p>The ancients sensed powerful primordial forces in the world. To make them approachable, they gave them human faces. They called them Zeus, Apollo, Aphrodite. American Indians felt the same mystery but rendered it in animistic forms–Bear Teacher, Hawk Messenger, Coyote Trickster.</p>

<p>"Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, magic, and power in it. Begin it now."</p>

<p>None of us are born as passive generic blobs waiting for the world to stamp its imprint on us. Instead we show up possessing already a highly refined and individuated soul. Another way of thinking of it is this: We're not born with unlimited choices. We can't be anything we want to be. We come into this world with a specific, personal destiny. We have a job to do, a calling to enact, a self to become. We are who we are from the cradle, and we're stuck with it. Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it.</p>

<p>A hack, he says, is a writer who second-guesses his audience. When the hack sits down to work, he doesn't ask himself what's in his own heart. He asks what the market is looking for. The hack condescends to his audience. He thinks he's superior to them. The truth is, he's scared to death of them or, more accurately, scared of being authentic in front of them, scared of writing what he really feels or believes, what he himself thinks is interesting.</p>

<p>Of any activity you do, ask yourself: If I were the last person on earth, would I still do it?</p>

<p>Contempt for failure is our cardinal virtue.</p>

<p>If you were meant to cure cancer or write a symphony or crack cold fusion and you don't do it, you not only hurt yourself, even destroy yourself. You hurt your children. You hurt me. You hurt the planet.</p>

<p>Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It's a gift to the world and every being in it. Don't cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you've got.</p>

<h2 id="useful-not-true">Useful Not True</h2>
<p><em>by Derek Sivers</em></p>

<p>And let's define "useful" as whatever helps you do what you need to do, be who you want to be, or feel at peace.</p>

<p>Remember this when someone gives facts as proof that their viewpoint is true. Facts can be true, while the perspective is not.</p>

<details>
  <summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #00FF41; font-weight: 500; margin: 10px 0;">see more</summary>
  <div>

<p>Memories feel like facts, but they're not. People don't doubt their memory, but you should.</p>

<p>Goals, plans, optimism, pessimism, and predictions themselves are pointless. But they're useful if they change behavior for the better. All that matters are current actions.</p>

<p>Calling someone a "flirt" means "I think that person has romantic intentions." Notice that words like these sound like facts about the person being judged, but they tell you more about the person judging.</p>

<p>They say it's your obligation, your duty, your responsibility. But those terms are social expectations. They're not real. They're not even universal.</p>

<p>The people saying it's your obligation really just want you to do something. But instead of saying "I want," they blame a higher legitimacy. It's manipulative. They say their wishes are laws you must obey.</p>

<p>Rules set expectations and the terms of the game. They're a useful starting point, but they're not the final answer.</p>

<p>Rules can be ignored. Sometimes, if a rule's purpose is understood and respected, and the greater good is not harmed, it's irrational and immoral to follow it.</p>

<p>When someone believes something that seems crazy to you, consider what incentives, from their point of view, make that belief useful.</p>

<p>No model is "true". Each one is just less and less wrong. The scientific process is never done.</p>

<p>You take some principles or values very seriously. You think of them as undeniable truths. But to other people, you are the one with silly beliefs.</p>

<p>Your identity and choices seem authentic and true. But you're subconsciously influenced by everything you see and hear. You have no idea why you want what you want or choose what you do.</p>

<p>Beliefs have a purpose. They help people adopt a perspective or identity. Beliefs help people take action, or cooperate with others. The only problem is when people confuse belief with reality, and insist that something is absolutely true because they believe it.</p>

<p>Ask yourself why you want the truth. What do you plan to do with it? What's the real outcome?</p>

<p>Ideas and beliefs are tools. Choose them for the desired effect.</p>

<p>Beliefs cause emotions. Emotions cause actions. Choose a belief for the action it will cause.</p>

<p>Which belief is right? Wrong question. Which belief will lead to the action you need now? Choose beliefs that are useful, not true.</p>

<p>Nothing has inherent meaning. Whatever meaning you project into it is your own.</p>

<p>Meanings can give you a reason to persist in difficult times. But they're internal, not external. They're yours, not others'.</p>

<h3>Questions to start</h3>
<h4>When something goes wrong</h4>
<p>What's great about this?<br>
How can I use this to my advantage?<br>
Does this change the goal, or the path, or nothing?<br>
How can I reduce the downsides?</p>

<h4>When changing direction</h4>
<p>When I was at my happiest, what was I doing?<br>
What have I strongly wanted for the longest time?<br>
What's the opposite of what I usually do?<br>
Which of my old beliefs are not serving me?<br>
Forget me. What would be most helpful for others?</p>

<h4>When stuck</h4>
<p>What is my one top priority now?<br>
How can I begin without waiting for anything?<br>
What advice would I love to hear from an all-knowing sage?<br>
What am I doing that's actually a distraction?<br>
Instead of avoiding mistakes, how can I make more to learn faster?<br>
Who can help?</p>

<h4>To make peace with what's out of your control</h4>
<p>What happens if I ignore it and do nothing?<br>
Should I learn a lesson from this, or just move on?<br>
How can I blame no one, and see this as nobody's fault?<br>
How can I be OK no matter what happens?</p>

<p>Almost nothing people say is true. My thoughts aren't true. Norms, obligations, the past, the future, and fears: none of it is real.</p>

<p>You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much.</p>

<p>Instead of asking if it's true, ask yourself if it's useful to you. What are you going to do about it? Will it really change your actions? If not, what does it matter?</p>

<p><em>by Jordan Peterson</em></p>
<p>Without rules we quickly become slaves to our passions - and there's nothing freeing about that.</p>

<p>We are quick to aim low and worship qualities that are beneath us.</p>

<p>The psychological mystery of self-deception: How can a person deceive himself and get away with it?</p>

<p>Be wary of ideology, no matter who is peddling it or to what end. Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it.</p>

<p>Adopt as much responsibility as possible for individual life, society and the world. Tell the truth. Repair what is in disrepair. Break down and recreate what is old and outdated. This is how we can and must reduce the suffering that poisons the world.</p>

<p>If a dominant lobster is badly defeated, its brain basically dissolves. Then it grows a new, subordinate's brain - one more appropriate to its new, lowly position.</p>

<p>Order is all the more "natural" the longer it has lasted. Because "nature" is "what selects," the longer a feature has existed, the more time it has had to be selected - and to shape life.</p>

<p>The dominance hierarchy has been around for some half a billion years. There is little more natural than culture.</p>

<p>When we are defeated, our posture droops. We face the ground. We feel threatened, hurt, anxious and weak. The ancient part of your brain specialized for assessing dominance watches how you are treated by other people. On that evidence, it renders a determination of your value and assigns you a status. If you are judged by your peers as of little worth, the counter restricts serotonin availability. That makes you much more physically and psychologically reactive to circumstances. When operating at the bottom, the ancient brain counter assumes that even the smallest unexpected impediment might produce an uncontrollable chain of negative events, which will have to be handled alone, as useful friends are rare at the bottom. It will render you impulsive, so that, for example, you will jump at any short-term mating opportunities, or any possibilities of pleasure, no matter how sub-par.</p>

<p>If you have a high status, mechanics assume that your niche is secure, productive and safe, and that you are well buttressed with social support. It thinks the chance that something will damage you is low and can be safely discounted. Change might be opportunity, instead of disaster. The serotonin flows plentifully. This renders you confident and calm, standing tall and straight, and much less on constant alert. Because your position is secure, the future is likely to be good for you. It's worthwhile to think in the long term and plan for a better tomorrow. You don't need to grasp impulsively at whatever crumbs come your way, because you can realistically expect good things to remain available. You can delay gratification, without forgoing it forever. You can afford to be a reliable and thoughtful citizen.</p>

<p>Our anxiety systems are very practical. They assume that anything you run away from is dangerous. The proof of that is, of course, the fact you ran away.</p>

<p>People who refuse to muster self-protective territorial responses are laid open to exploitation as much as those who genuinely can't stand up for their own rights</p>

<p>Bureaucracies have petty authoritarians within them, generating unnecessary rules and procedures simply to express and cement power.</p>

<p>The willingness of the individual to stand up for him or herself protects everyone from the corruption of society.</p>

<p>There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. Dare to be dangerous.</p>

<p>Those who start to have will probably get more. These upwardly moving loops can occur in your own private, subjective space.</p>

<p>See the gold the dragon hoards, instead of shrinking in terror from the dragon.</p>

<p>The dividing line between order and chaos: That's where we are simultaneously stable enough, exploring enough, transforming enough, repairing enough, and cooperating enough. To straddle that is to be balanced: to have one foot firmly planted in order and security, and the other in chaos, possibility, growth and adventure. When life suddenly reveals itself as intense, gripping and meaningful; when time passes and you're so engrossed in what you're doing you don't notice - it is there and then that you are located precisely on the border between order and chaos.</p>

<p>Place one foot in what you have mastered and understood, and the other in what you are currently exploring and mastering.</p>

<p>Chaos is the despair and horror you feel when you have been profoundly betrayed.</p>

<p>Chaos is where we are when we don't know where we are, and what we are doing when we don't know what we are doing. It is all those things and situations we neither know nor understand.</p>

<p>We all have a palpable sense of the chaos lurking under everything familiar. That's why we understand the strange, surreal stories of Pinocchio, and Sleeping Beauty, and The Lion King, and The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast, with their eternal landscapes of known and unknown, world and underworld.</p>

<p>Paradise = pairidaeza in old Iranian or Avestan, which means walled or protected enclosure or garden.</p>

<p>Old stories contain nothing superfluous. Anything accidental - anything that does not serve the plot - has long been forgotten in the telling.</p>

<p>Heaven is something you must build. Immortality is something you must earn.</p>

<p>Treat yourself as if you were someone you are responsible for helping.</p>

<p>People are better at filling and properly administering prescription medication to their pets than to themselves.</p>

<p>People often don't really believe that they deserve the best care. Instead of narcissistically inflating their own importance, they don't value themselves.</p>

<p>It is not virtuous to be victimized by a bully, even if that bully is oneself.</p>

<p>If I am someone's friend, family member, or lover, then I am morally obliged to bargain as hard on my own behalf as they are on theirs. If I fail to do so, I will end up a slave, and the other person a tyrant.</p>

<p>It is much better for any relationship when both partners are strong.</p>

<p>There is little difference between standing up and speaking for yourself, and standing up and speaking for someone else.</p>

<p>You do not simply belong to yourself. You are not simply your own possession to torture and mistreat. Your mistreatment of yourself can have catastrophic consequences for others.</p>

<p>Enough people look beyond themselves that we have central heat and running water. It is only the constant attention of careful people that keeps it working so unbelievably well.</p>

<p>Some people degenerate into the hell of resentment, but most refuse to do so.</p>

<p>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others' taking inappropriate advantage of you.</p>

<p>You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</p>

<p>Define who you are. Refine your personality.</p>

<p>When you move cities/countries, there are new possibilities. People, including you, can't hem you in with their old notions. You get shaken out of your ruts. You can make new, better ruts, with people aiming at better things.</p>

<p>Cities provide anonymity.</p>

<p>People create their worlds with the tools they have directly at hand.</p>

<p>Not everyone who is failing is a victim. Not everyone at the bottom wishes to rise.</p>

<p>Distinguish between someone truly wanting and needing help, and someone who is merely exploiting a willing helper.</p>

<p>The person who tries and fails, and is forgiven, and then tries again and fails, and is forgiven, is also too often the person who wants everyone to believe in the authenticity of all that trying.</p>

<p>A boss moves a problematic person into the midst of a stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens? The entire team degenerates. Place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability. Down is a lot easier than up.</p>

<p>Are you enabling a delusion? Is it possible that your contempt would be more helpful than your pity?</p>

<p>If you buy the story that everything terrible just happened on its own, with no personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that person all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future, as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power.</p>

<p>It is far more likely that a given individual has just decided to reject the path upward, because of its difficulty. Failure is easy to understand. In the same manner, fear, hatred, addiction, promiscuity, betrayal and deception. It's easier not to shoulder a burden. It's easier not to think, and not to do, and not to care. It's easier to put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today.</p>

<p>To fail, you merely have to cultivate a few bad habits. You just have to bide your time.</p>

<p>Loyalty must be negotiated.</p>

<p>Associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve. People who support your upward aim will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness. They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not.</p>

<p>When you dare aspire upward, you reveal the inadequacy of the present and the promise of the future. Then you disturb others, in the depths of their souls, where they understand that their cynicism and immobility are unjustifiable.</p>

<p>It's easier for people to be good at something in small, rural communities. Local heroes have the opportunity to enjoy the serotonin-fuelled confidence of the victor. People born in small towns are statistically overrepresented among the eminent.</p>

<p>People are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be. A very small number of people produce very much of everything.</p>

<p>If the cards are always stacked against you, perhaps the game you are playing is somehow rigged - perhaps by you.</p>

<p>A cliché of nihilism: "In a million years, who's going to know the difference?" The proper response to that statement is not, "Well, then, everything is meaningless." It's, "Any idiot can choose a frame of time within which nothing matters."</p>

<p>Standards of better or worse are not illusory or unnecessary. If you hadn't decided that what you are doing right now was better than the alternatives, you wouldn't be doing it. The idea of a value-free choice is a contradiction in terms. Value judgments are a precondition for action. Furthermore, every activity, once chosen, comes with its own internal standards of accomplishment. If something can be done at all, it can be done better or worse.</p>

<p>Winning at everything might only mean that you're not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you're not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.</p>

<p>Before you can articulate your own standards of value, you must see yourself as a stranger - and then you must get to know yourself.</p>

<p>Dare to be truthful. Dare to articulate yourself, and express what would really justify your life.</p>

<p>If you allowed your dark and unspoken desires to manifest themselves - if you were even willing to consider them - you might discover that they were not so dark, given the light of day. You might discover, instead, that you were just afraid and, so, pretending to be moral.</p>

<p>Are you so sure that your partner would be unhappy if more of you rose to the surface?</p>

<p>Consult your resentment. It's a revelatory emotion. Resentment always means one of two things. Either the resentful person is immature, in which case he or she should shut up, quit whining, and get on with it. Or is being taken advantage of (or allowing yourself to be taken advantage of).</p>

<p>What are you inclined to lie about, assuming that the truth might be intolerable? What do you fake?</p>

<p>We are always and simultaneously at point "a" (which is less desirable than it could be), moving towards point "b" (which we deem better).</p>

<p>We live within a framework that defines the present as eternally lacking and the future as eternally better. If we did not see things this way, we would not act at all.</p>

<p>Happiness is found in the journey uphill, and not in the fleeting sense of satisfaction awaiting at the next peak.</p>

<p>What you aim at determines what you see. To deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world, you ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns. You're blind to everything else. Perhaps what you really need is right in front of your eyes, but you cannot see it because of what you are currently aiming for.</p>

<p>The world revealed whatever goodness it contains in precise proportion to your desire for the best.</p>

<p>You cannot aim yourself at anything if you are completely undisciplined and untutored. You only see what you aim at.</p>

<p>You can only find out what you actually believe by watching how you act.</p>

<p>"What is it that is bothering me?" "Is that something I could fix?" "Would I actually be willing to fix it?" If you find that the answer is "no," to any or all of the questions, then look elsewhere. Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day.</p>

<p>It's not for the best that all human corruption is uncritically laid at society's feet. That conclusion merely displaces the problem, back in time. It explains nothing, and solves no problems. If society is corrupt, but not the individuals within it, then where did the corruption originate? How is it propagated? It's a one-sided, deeply ideological theory.</p>

<p>Each person's private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution, because revolutions are destabilizing and dangerous. We have learned to live together and organize our complex societies slowly and incrementally, over vast stretches of time, and we do not understand with sufficient exactitude why what we are doing works. Thus, altering our ways of social being carelessly in the name of some ideological shibboleth (diversity springs to mind) is likely to produce far more trouble than good, given the suffering that even small revolutions generally produce.</p>

<p>The adolescent ethos of the 1960s, a decade whose excesses led to the inability to distinguish between the chaos of immaturity and responsible freedom.</p>

<p>Children, like other human beings, are not only good, they cannot simply be left to their own devices, untouched by society, and bloom into perfection. Even dogs must be socialized if they are to become acceptable members of the pack - and children are much more complex than dogs. This means that they are much more likely to go complexly astray if they are not trained, disciplined and properly encouraged.</p>

<p>Parents are the arbiters of society. They teach children how to behave so that other people will be able to interact meaningfully and productively with them. It is an act of responsibility to discipline a child.</p>

<p>People often get basic psychological questions backwards. Why do people suffer from anxiety? That's not a mystery. How is that people can ever be calm? There's the mystery. Violence is the default. It's easy. It's peace that is difficult: learned, inculcated, earned.</p>

<p>Parents must reward those attitudes and actions that will bring their child success in the world outside the family, and use threat and punishment when necessary to eliminate behaviours that will lead to misery and failure.</p>

<p>Much more of our sanity than we commonly realize is a consequence of our fortunate immersion in a social community.</p>

<p>Bad laws drive out respect for good laws. So, don't encumber children with too many rules.</p>

<p>"Limit the rules to what, exactly?" Here are some suggestions: Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence. Do not torture and bully other children, so you don't end up in jail. Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by adults, so they don't hate you and might therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you're lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you're invited for the fun. Act so that other people are happy you're around, so that people will want you around. A child who knows these rules will be welcome everywhere.</p>

<p>Parents have a duty to act as proxies for the real world. This obligation supersedes any responsibility to ensure happiness, foster creativity, or boost self-esteem.</p>

<p>A child who pays attention, instead of drifting, and is comical, but not annoying, and is trustworthy - that child will have friends wherever he goes.</p>

<p>It is possible to learn good by experiencing evil.</p>

<p>The majority of people who were abused as children do not abuse their own children.</p>

<p>The desire for vengeance, however justified, also bars the way to other productive thoughts.</p>

<p>If it's her fault, she might be able to do something about it. If it's God's fault, however - if reality itself is flawed - then she is doomed.</p>

<p>A hurricane is an act of God. But failure to prepare, when the necessity for preparation is well known - that's sin.</p>

<p>Have you taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to you? Do you have habits that are destroying your health and well-being? Are you truly shouldering your responsibilities?</p>

<p>Don't reorganize the state until you have ordered your own experience.</p>

<p>There is little difference between sacrifice and work. They are also both uniquely human.</p>

<p>The discovery of the causal relationship between our efforts today and the quality of tomorrow motivated the social contract - the organization that enables today's work to be stored, reliably, mostly in the form of promises from others.</p>

<p>It takes a long time to learn to keep anything later for yourself. You are sharing with your future self.</p>

<p>The future is largely composed of other human beings - often precisely those who have watched and evaluated and appraised the tiniest details of your past behavior.</p>

<p>To share does not mean to give away something you value, and get nothing back. That is instead only what every child who refuses to share fears it means. To share means, properly, to initiate the process of trade.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a newcomer to a neighbourhood ask a new neighbour to do him or her a favour. The latter could now ask the former for a favour, in return, because of the debt incurred, increasing their mutual familiarity and trust. In that manner both parties could overcome their natural hesitancy and mutual fear of the stranger.</p>

<p>The society produced by Christianity was far less barbaric than the pagan - even the Roman - ones it replaced. Christian society at least recognized that feeding slaves to ravenous lions for the entertainment of the populace was wrong, even if many barbaric practices still existed. It objected to infanticide, to prostitution, and to the principle that might means right. It insisted that women were as valuable as men. This was asking the impossible, but it happened.</p>

<p>After the solution is implemented, the fact that such problems had ever existed disappears from view.</p>

<p>The fact that automobiles pollute only becomes a problem of sufficient magnitude to attract public attention when the far worse problems that the internal combustion engine solves has vanished from view. People stricken with poverty don't care about carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>Nietzsche described himself as philosophizing with a hammer.</p>

<p>An idea that grips a person is alive. It wants to express itself, to live in the world. When an idea manifests itself within a person, it has a strong proclivity to make of that person its avatar: to impel that person to act it out. Sometimes the person will die, rather than allowing the idea to perish. Only the idea need die, and that the person with the idea can stop being its avatar, change his or her ways, and continue.</p>

<p>Once you have placed "make the world better" at the top of your value hierarchy, you experience ever-deepening meaning. It's how you make amends for the pathology of history.</p>

<p>Expedience: That's avoiding responsibility. It's cowardly, and shallow, and wrong. There is no faith and no courage and no sacrifice in doing what is expedient.</p>

<p>What should you do, when you don't know what to do? Tell the truth.</p>

<p>People define their utopia and then bend their lives into knots trying to make it reality.</p>

<p>An eighteen-year-old decides, arbitrarily, that she wants to retire at fifty-two. She works for three decades to make that happen, failing to notice that she made that decision when she was little more than a child. What did she know about her fifty-two-year-old self, when still a teenager?</p>

<p>Oversimplification and falsification is particularly typical of ideologues. They adopt a single axiom: government is bad, immigration is bad, capitalism is bad, patriarchy is bad. Then they filter and screen their experiences and insist ever more narrowly that everything can be explained by that axiom.</p>

<p>If you will not reveal yourself to others, so much of what you could be will never be forced by necessity to come forward.</p>

<p>New genes in the central nervous system turn themselves on when an organism is placed (or places itself) in a new situation. These are the building blocks for new structures in the brain. A lot of you will not be called forth by stasis. You have to say something, go somewhere and do things to get turned on.</p>

<p>If you have a weak character, then adversity will mow you down when it appears.</p>

<p>Everyone needs a concrete, specific goal - an ambition, and a purpose. An aim provides a destination. An aim defines progress and makes such progress exciting. If you have no aim everything can mean anything or nothing.</p>

<p>Error necessitates sacrifice to correct it. Every bit of learning is a little death. Every bit of new information challenges a previous conception, forcing it to dissolve into chaos before it can be reborn as something better. Sometimes such deaths virtually destroy us.</p>

<p>Advice is what you get when the person you're talking with about something horrible and complicated wishes you would just shut up and go away. Advice is what you get when the person you are talking to wants to revel in the superiority of his or her own intelligence.</p>

<p>There was no way of knowing the objective truth, and there never would be. There was no objective observer, and there never would be. There was no complete and accurate story.</p>

<p>Memory is the past's guide to the future. If you remember that something bad happened, and you can figure out why, then you can try to avoid that bad thing happening again. That's the purpose of memory. It's not "to remember the past." It's to stop the same damn thing from happening over and over.</p>

<p>To think, you have to be at least two people at the same time. Then you have to let those people disagree. Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world.</p>

<p>What are you to do, then, if you aren't very good at thinking, at being two people at one time? That's easy. You talk. But you need someone to listen. A listening person is your collaborator and your opponent. A listening person tests your talking (and your thinking) without having to say anything.</p>

<p>Summarize to aid in consolidation and utility of memory. A long, meandering, emotion-laden account becomes shorter. It is now summed up in your memory It is now a better memory. It is now less weighty. It has been distilled; reduced to the gist. We have extracted the moral of the story. It becomes a description of the cause and the result of what happened, formulated such that repetition of the tragedy and pain becomes less likely in the future. "This is what happened. This is why. This is what I have to do to avoid such things from now on": That's a successful memory. That's the purpose of memory.</p>

<p>To discuss an event, particularly something emotional, like a death or serious illness, is to slowly choose what to leave behind.</p>

<p>We use the reactions of others to keep our complex selves functional.</p>

<p>People organize their brains with conversation. If they don't have anyone to tell their story to, they lose their minds. Like hoarders, they cannot unclutter themselves.</p>

<p>Too-early problem-solving may indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating conversation.</p>

<p>If you identify things, with careful attention and language, you bring them forward as viable, obedient objects, detaching them from their underlying near-universal interconnectedness. You simplify them. You make them specific and useful, and reduce their complexity. If you leave things vague, then this makes the world too complex to be managed.</p>

<p>Consciously define the topic of a conversation, particularly when it is difficult.</p>

<p>You must determine where you have been in your life, so that you can know where you are now. Otherwise you can't get to where you're going.</p>

<p>Say what you mean, so you can find out what you mean. Act out what you say, so you can find out what happens. Then pay attention. Note your errors. Articulate them. Strive to correct them.</p>

<p>Admit to what you want. Tell those around you who you are.</p>

<p>Children weren't trying to be safe — they were trying to become competent. It's competence that makes people as safe as they can truly be. If things are made too safe, people (including children) start to figure out ways to make them dangerous again.</p>

<p>When someone says, too loudly, "I stand for this!", always wonder, "What, then, do you stand against?"</p>

<p>If you cannot understand why someone did something, look at the consequences - and infer the motivation.</p>

<p>If someone is taking advantage of you, you now face a moral obligation to speak up for yourself. Gather some evidence, strategically, so that when you confront that person, you can give them several examples of their misbehaviour (at least three), so they can't easily weasel out of your accusations. It might mean failing to concede when they offer you their counterarguments. People rarely have more than four at hand. If you remain unmoved, they get angry, or cry, or run away. If you can push your point past the first four responses and stand fast against the consequent emotion, you will gain your target's attention - and, perhaps, their respect. You must also know clearly what you want out of the situation, and be prepared to clearly articulate your desire. It's a good idea to tell the person you are confronting exactly what you would like them to do instead of what they have done or currently are doing. Make your request as small and reasonable as possible - but ensure that its fulfillment would satisfy you. Come to the discussion with a solution, instead of just a problem.</p>

<p>A woman should not look after a man, because she must look after children, and a man should not be a child.</p>

<p>Women don't want boys. They want someone to contend with; someone to grapple with. If they're tough, they want someone tougher. If they're smart, they want someone smarter. They desire someone who brings to the table something they can't already provide.</p>

<p>If you think tough men are dangerous, wait until you see what weak men are capable of.</p>

<p>"Minimal group identification:" People are social because they like the members of their own group. People are antisocial because they don't like the members of other groups.</p>

<p>Cooperation is for safety, security and companionship. Competition is for personal growth and status. If a group is too small, it has no power or prestige, and cannot fend off other groups. Being one of its members is not that useful. If a group is too large, the probability of climbing to the top declines. So, it becomes too hard to get ahead.</p>

<p>Sacrifice everything you hold dear to yet greater perfection. Let the deadwood burn off, so that new growth can prevail.</p>
